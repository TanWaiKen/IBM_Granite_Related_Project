# IBM_Granite_Related_Project

IntroductionÂ¶
Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using the open-sourced IBM Granite AI foundation models for a number of use cases that demonstrates the value of generative AI.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Summarize a text document using text summarization
2. Generate specific information from a large document using the RAG technique
3. Predict future trends using time series forecasting
4. Extract entities from an unstructured text document using entity recognition
5. Multimodal RAG using a multimodal LLM (MLLM) on a PDF file with images.


Agenda
Lab 1: Document Summarization with Granite	Learn how to use an AI model to summarize a work of literature

Lab 2: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Langchain	Learn how to generate specific information from a large document

Lab 3: Energy Demand Forecasting with Granite Timeseries (TTM)	Learn how to predict future trends using time series forecasting

Lab 4: Entity Extraction from text using Granite	Learn how to use an AI model to extract entities from unstructured text.

Lab 5: Multimodal RAG using Granite and Docling	Learn how to use AI models to generate specific information from unstructured PDFs with images.
