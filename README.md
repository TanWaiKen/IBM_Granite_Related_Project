# IBM_Granite_Related_Project

Introduction

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using the open-sourced IBM Granite AI foundation models for a number of use cases that demonstrates the value of generative AI.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Summarize a text document using text summarization
2. Generate specific information from a large document using the RAG technique
3. Predict future trends using time series forecasting
4. Extract entities from an unstructured text document using entity recognition
5. Multimodal RAG using a multimodal LLM (MLLM) on a PDF file with images.
